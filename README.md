# Vila-Stem 8
Hello, we are the Vila-Stem 8 team. 
We come from an academy of Vila-real (Vila-Stem)

# Team
It's our first year competing in Future Engineers, the truth is that we are quite excited to start this, it's a new challenge for us.
Our team is formed by 3 people of different ages, led by our captain Anes.
We have Juan who is an expert in Arduino, he is the one who taught us everything at the beginning, he is a fan of Arduino and everything related.
And finally there is me, Ainhoa, I started doing Arduino a long time ago but I barely remembered, now I have very nice memories. We can say that my job has been to oversee the programming and make the construction of the robot.

We have the idea to go all out, do the 3 laps of the course and then try the obstacle detection. The truth is that the process of programming the robot has been very difficult, because every day it did something different. In the end we decided that for each modification we would make a copy of the program so that if it failed it would be easier to detect the failure.

# Robot
Building the robot was one of the easiest things ever. We started by taking ideas from previous years. We bought the basics, board one, some wheels, screws and distance sensors. The base we decided to make it from scratch in 3d. We drew what we wanted and then we took it to Tinkercad where we printed it. We made a nice base with everything ready, where to put the sensors, the battery and the most important thing, the board!

# Errors
When we started programming we realized towards the end that we had to modify the structure of the robot a bit. The sensors that we had placed on the sides needed to be moved to the corners, as they would detect the walls better.

# MODIFICATIONS AFTER THE REGIONAL COMPETITION
In Denia we learned a lot about our mistakes, we also followed improvement instructions that our jury told us. 
What we modified the most was the robot: We changed the arduino for an ESP32 because it gave us better results, we were thinking of using a rasperry pi but we control more C +++ and not so much phyton. Other modifications were in the program, which we were told was a botch, that the variables that we had created should be in English and not in Valencian. All the recommendations that they gave us we wrote them down to improve the robot for the final of Spain, in CÃ¡ceres.
