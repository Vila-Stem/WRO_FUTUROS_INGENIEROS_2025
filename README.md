# Our journey
This text contains our struggles and achievements, which we have came across during our few months of preparation. How many things we had to redesign, how many things we had to figure out to make our robot work.

## Team
Our team consists of 3 members and a coach, we are the Vila-Stem 8 team from Vila-real. This is our first year competing together in WRO, but is our first year in the Future Engineers category.

# Robot
Building the robot was one of the easiest things ever. We started by taking ideas from previous years. We bought the basics, board one, some wheels, screws and distance sensors. The base we decided to make it from scratch in 3d. We drew what we wanted and then we took it to Tinkercad where we printed it. We made a nice base with everything ready, where to put the sensors, the battery and the most important thing, the board!

# Errors
When we started programming we realized towards the end that we had to modify the structure of the robot a bit. The sensors that we had placed on the sides needed to be moved to the corners, as they would detect the walls better.

# MODIFICATIONS AFTER THE REGIONAL COMPETITION
In Denia we learned a lot about our mistakes, we also followed improvement instructions that our jury told us. 
What we modified the most was the robot: We changed the arduino for an ESP32 because it gave us better results, we were thinking of using a rasperry pi but we control more C +++ and not so much phyton. Other modifications were in the program, which we were told was a botch, that the variables that we had created should be in English and not in Valencian. All the recommendations that they gave us we wrote them down to improve the robot for the final of Spain, in CÃ¡ceres.
